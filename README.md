# AD Honey Account + Auto-Block System (Coming Soon)

This project will demonstrate how a fake Active Directory user (honey account) can be used to detect suspicious login attempts.  
The goal is to forward the alert to a SIEM and automatically block the attacker’s IP.

More updates will be added as I build the project.
